# todo
This is a project I did for learning JavaScript, of course it is far from perfect but it has some really cool functionality. It has the possibity for filtering to do, editing to do. The best part of this To Do is that the To Do are not actually connected to an internet database, it is just saved in your own computer. The UI is really intuitive, so no much explanation must be done. 
### Huge thanks to 4tomik for teaching me how to do this stuff.
